# Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI

Interactive sales dashboard built with Power BI to analyze customer behavior, revenue trends, and product performance.

## Introduction

This project features an interactive sales dashboard created with Power BI. It provides insights into customer behavior, revenue trends, and product performance across three key cities. The goal is to derive actionable insights to support decision-making.

The dashboard was built using basic Power BI techniques, including data transformation without employing a star schema. It consists of a single data element, focusing on KPI visualization and basic transformations.
